Dear Future Me,

I hope you are doing well.

Cheers,\
Present Me (Past You)

I spent the major part of today just walking on the beach.
It is Monday today, but also a public holiday, hence I am not in the office.

It is early October, the summer season is over, there are much less people on the beach now than a few weeks ago.
The air is also noticable corlder.

All this does not seem to deter the surfers in any way. 
In fact the waves have been quite big for the last few days, that is why all the pro guys are out there. 
And that is also the reason why I prefer to stay on the beach.

I have spent quite some time lately thinking about all sort of phylosofical questions.
Hardly any answers though, unfortunately.
We may call it an existential crisis, if you like.
Some may prefer to call it mid-life crisis. 
I will stay away from doing so, given that we have no way of knowing how long our life is going to be, we cannot ever be sure if we are anywhere near the middle of it.
